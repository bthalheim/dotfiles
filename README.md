Dotfiles And Profile Configs 
=======================================================

A collection of personal profile and dotfile configurations and notes. There are configurations and notes for both Windows and Linux based systems.

Current Configuration Goals: 
* Maintain a similar experience between Windows(WSL,CMD,PS) and Linux systems. Since I have to support windows systems I think its important to create as much of a posix style productive system as possible.  
* Configurations are mostly for a nice experience and only slight rebinding for productivity. Since many utilities are used on remote servers I think its important to maintain muscle memory for common bindings so as not to be lost on remote systems.
