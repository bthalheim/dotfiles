#+TITLE: Emacs Configurations

A repo of various emacs configurations and environments. Including some custom
codes and automation paths.

* Summary

Emacs configuration repo for working configurations and building Modules. Also
testing magit interfacing.

General Commands And Reference:
+ ~C-x o~ cycles panes.
+ Execute a custom config file with ~emacs -q -l config.el~
+ Tangle org files with ~C-c C-v t~

** Goals:
+ Fully tangle-able configuration.
+ Prefer built in modules where possible to limit the need for external code
  where needed.
+ Convert to using multiple org files tangled using import to modularize the
  file. Generated file should maybe be cleaned after its created to make an init
  file that can be reviewed and readable as needed.
+ Pull in external projects where it makes sense to local repos to maintain full
  control of source, possibly even as far as creating local mirrors.

+ Add Journaling + Combine workflows with agenda.

General notes on working with magit.

+ ~C-x g~  opens magit staus screen.
+ In status ~g~ for refreshing the status window. 
+ In status ~s~ for staging.
+ In status ~c~ for commit.
+ In status ~l l~ for reviewing log.

** Goals
+ Maybe a common org format for repo readme.org files.
+ Org Export readme to markdown, some git repo hosts dont handle org mode (bitbucket).
+ Local git (gitea) for generic projects?


* Project Notes

** Goals
+ Command for auto stubbing a project in a folder.
+ Move away from projectile to see if the built in project software can fill the gap.
+ Investigate using the .projectile/.project file for extra config settings.
  + Project tagging.
+ Add option to retire/archive old projects.
  + Should continue to have some way of searching over older projects.
  + Possibly an additional command to search just the archive sections.
+ Change Project Clean
  + Close buffers not related to project when cahnging project.
  + Search for files only inside the current project

** Commands
+ projectile-discover-projects-in-search-directory

** Common Bindings
+ C-c p p : Open Project
+ C-c p k : Kill all open project buffers

* Org Mode Improvements
